=head1 NAME

fabsys_restore-kill - Forcibly kill a running restore request

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fabsys restore-kill> <I<req_id>> [B<--note> <I<note>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<fabsys restore-kill> command causes a running restore request run to
abort, and immediately be considered "failed". This can be useful if a backup
run was accidentally started, or if a run is malfunctioning or hanging for some
reason.

Note that killing a backup run does not immediately kill in-progress volume
restore processes, or aspects of a restore request. However, all aspects of the
request should notice fairly quickly that the request run has failed (after a
few minutes at most), and will abort themselves.
